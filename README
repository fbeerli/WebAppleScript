description:
	- webserver on localhost to call specified websites with AppleScript

improved/revise:
	- webserver can start any script from directory script without changing server.js
	- every request is logged in the terminal reported with date and time
	- change script name from xxx.app to xxx.scpt

todo:
	- list all files on Website from directory /script

installation:
	- install node
	- install npm
	- copy the folder "script_call_x.x.x" to any directory on your computer
	
start webserver:
	- on terminal go to directory "script_call_x.x.x" and type "npm start"

PROBLEM:
	- Safari calls every 2 Minutes the link(s) the user has once clicked
