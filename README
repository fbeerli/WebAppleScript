description:
	- webserver on localhost to call specified websites with AppleScript

improved/revise:
	- webserver can start any script from directory script without changing server.js
	- every request is logged in the terminal reported with date and time
	- change script name from xxx.app to xxx.
	- use "res.end()" in server.js for app.get()-function to stop Safari request all 2 Minutes
	- npm install fs --save
	- npm install ejs --save
	- npm install path --save
	- npm install jslint --save
	- read directory ./apple_script dynamically and create a list of links for each scipt

todo:	
    - create a dynamic index.html
	- set "localhost" in links to server-ip-address dynamically 
	- read directory ./apple_script/ and list files as links in a html table to call AppleScript dynamically

installation:
	- install node
	- install npm
	- copy the folder "script_call_x.x.x" to any directory on your computer
	
start webserver:
	- on terminal go to directory "apple_script" and type "npm start"

test:
	- sometimes for the first time Safari does not start when click on a link in the Website
