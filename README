improved/revise:
	- webserver can start any script from directory script without changing server.js
	- every request is logged in the terminal reported with date and time

	- use "res.end()" in server.js for app.get()-function to stop Safari request all 2 Minutes
	- npm install fs --save
	- npm install ejs --save

todo:	
    - create a dynamic index.html
	- set "localhost" in links to server-ip-address dynamically 
	- read directory ./script/ and list files as links in a html table to call AppleScript dynamically
